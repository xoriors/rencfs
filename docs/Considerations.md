# Considerations

- Please note that this project doesn't try to reinvent the wheel or be better than already proven implementations
- This project doesn't want to be a replacement in any way for already proven file encryption solutions. If you really
  want to be close to bulletproof solutions, then maybe this is not the ideal one for you. But is trying to offer a simple use
  of an encryption solution that should be used, taking into consideration all the security concerns from above
- It started as a learning project of Rust programming language, and I feel like I keep building more on it
- It's a fairly simple and standard implementation that tries to respect all security standards and correctly use secure and robust
  primitives so that it can be extended from this. Indeed, it doesn't have the maturity yet to "fight" other well-known
  implementations.
  But it can be a project from which others can learn or build upon, or why not for some to actually use it, keeping in
  mind all the above
